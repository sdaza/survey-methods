## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to survey methodology. We will cover the generation of survey data, their limitations, and techniques for adjusting and analyzing data to obtain accurate estimates. The course explores various aspects such as interview methods, sampling concepts, and instrumentation issues. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to reviewing research that examines the impact of survey design features on survey errors and practical approaches for sampling and analyzing survey data.

## Objectives

This course includes classroom lectures and activities. By successfully completing the course, you will gain an understanding of the potential and limitations of survey methodology and how they relate to data science challenges and issues.

## Books
 
Readings of the course combine book chapters and research papers. All the readings will be available through [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). It would be best if you asked to be part of the [course group here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4707314/survey-methods) to access research papers and books. Please, create an account if you don't have one.

The key books of the course are: 

- **SM** = Groves, Robert M., Floyd J. Fowler Jr, Mick P. Couper, James M. Lepkowski, Eleanor Singer, and Roger Tourangeau. 2009. **Survey Methodology**. 2nd ed. Wiley.
- **HSM** = Gideon, Lior, ed. 2012. **Handbook of Survey Methodology for the Social Sciences**. New York, NY: Springer New York.
- **HSR** = Marsden, Peter V., and James D. Wright, eds. 2010. ** Handbook of Survey Research**. Second edition. Bingley, UK: Emerald.
- **TSE** = Biemer, Paul P., Edith Desir√©e de Leeuw, Stephanie Eckman, Brad Edwards, Frauke Kreuter, Lars Lyberg, Clyde Tucker, and Brady T. West, eds. 2017. **Total Survey Error in Practice**. Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley.

## Class dynamic 

The course combines lectures, short student presentations, and practical exercises. We will read approximately two chapters/articles per week. 

## Evaluation: 

Students' grades will depend on the following: 

- Active participation (discussion) + short presentations during the class (25%)
- Weekly short assignments (25%)
- Final project (50%) 

### Participation and short presentations

In each class, each student will present one research paper in about 5 minutes (no slides) as a way to practice the *elevator speech*. Each presentation should be able to summarize a paper by presenting the question o problem it's trying to solve, why it's important, how authors face the issue, the results conclusion, good features, and limitations of the paper or chapter. The rest of the students will ask questions to the presenter after the presentation.
    
### Short exercises

There will be 2-3 practice exercises. They will sometimes be the base for class discussion.

### Final project

This project requires you to write a brief proposal to conduct a survey. I will provide a detailed description of the proyect at least three weeks before the project is due. You must work independently on this project. The maximum length is ten pages of text. All course papers must be written professionally following the format: at least 1-inch margins, double-spaced, 12 font size (Times New Roman), and page-numbered.
